# semikite

Ideas to program the semi-automatic algorithm for the kite:
- use pygame
- use pynput


Next step is to make the algorithm for many pictures (it should be possible to upload a folder with images and then do the code for all of them).
Also maybe increase the window size for better visibility and more accurate clicks?
